# Keymap Manager

Allows commands to be associated with keystrokes in a context-sensitive way. In Inkdrop, you can access a global instance of this object via `inkdrop.keymaps`.{{ className: 'lead' }}

Key bindings are JavaScript objects containing **CSS selectors** as their top-level keys, with **keystroke patterns** mapped to commands.

## Key Binding Syntax

<Row>
  <Col>
    When a keystroke sequence matches a binding in a given context, a custom DOM event with a type based on the command is dispatched on the target of the keyboard event.

    To match a keystroke sequence, the keymap starts at the target element for the keyboard event.
    It looks for key bindings associated with selectors that match the target element.
    If multiple match, the most specific is selected.
    If there is a tie in specificity, the most recently added binding wins.
    If no bindings are found for the events target, the search is repeated again for the target's parent node and so on recursively until a binding is found or we traverse off the top of the document.

    When a binding is found, its command event is always dispatched on the original target of the keyboard event, even if the matching element is higher up in the DOM.
    In addition, `.preventDefault()` is called on the keyboard event to prevent the browser from taking action.
    `.preventDefault` is only called if a matching binding is found.

    Command event objects have a non-standard method called `.abortKeyBinding()`.
    If your command handler is invoked but you programmatically determine that no action can be taken and you want to allow other bindings to be matched, call `.abortKeyBinding()` on the event object.
    An example of where this is useful is binding snippet expansion to `tab`.
    If `snippets:expand` is invoked when the cursor does not follow a valid snippet prefix, we abort the binding and allow `tab` to be handled by the default handler, which inserts whitespace.

    Multi-keystroke bindings are possible. If a sequence of one or more keystrokes partially matches a multi-keystroke binding, the keymap enters a pending state.
    The pending state is terminated on the next keystroke, or after `::getPartialMatchTimeout` milliseconds has elapsed.
    When the pending state is terminated via a timeout or a keystroke that leads to no matches, the longest ambiguous bindings that caused the pending state are temporarily disabled and the previous keystrokes are replayed.
    If there is ambiguity again during the replay, the next longest bindings are disabled and the keystrokes are replayed again.

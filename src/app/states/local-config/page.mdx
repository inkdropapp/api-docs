# localConfig

An [app state](/guides/flux-architecture) of [the local config](/modules/config) currently loaded.
This state allows you to use the config values of [`config.json`](https://docs.inkdrop.app/reference/user-data-directory) in your react components.
It immediately reflects to the state whenever the config file is changed.
The data structure is same as the file content.{{ className: 'lead' }}

## Accessing the State

<Row>
  <Col>
    The `localConfig` state provides information about the currently loaded local configuration settings of the application.
  </Col>
  <Col sticky>
    To get the `localConfig` state manually:

    ```js
    const { localConfig } = inkdrop.store.getState()
    ```

    Connect the state with your React component:

    ```js
      import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
      const selector = ({ localConfig }) => localConfig
      const MyComponent = props => {
        const localConfig = useSelector(selector)
        // render
      }
    ```
  </Col>
</Row>

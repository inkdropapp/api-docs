<Row>
  <Col>
    The state represents [Note][note] data while a note opened, otherwise it's `null` or `undefined`.
  </Col>

    ```

    Connect the state with your React component:

    ```js
    import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
    const selector = ({ editingNote }) => editingNote
    const MyComponent = props => {
      const editingNote = useSelector(selector)
      // render
    }
    ```

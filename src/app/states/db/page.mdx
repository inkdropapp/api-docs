    ```js
    const { db } = inkdrop.store.getState()
    ```

    Connect the state with your React component:

    ```js
    import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
    const selector = ({ db }) => db
    const MyComponent = props => {
      const db = useSelector(selector)
      // render
    }
    ```

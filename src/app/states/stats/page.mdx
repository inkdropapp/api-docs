    Get the `stats` state manually:

    ```js
    const { stats } = inkdrop.store.getState()
    ```

    Connect the state with your React component:

    ```js
    import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
    const selectStats = ({ stats }) => stats
    const MyComponent = props => {
      const stats = useSelector(selectStats)
      // render
    }
    ```

    Example stats data:

    ```json
    {
      "notes": 141,
      "pins": 4,
      "tags": {
        "tag:HyBgJ94gx": 12,

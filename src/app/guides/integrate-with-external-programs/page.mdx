# Integrate with External Programs via Local HTTP Server

If you want to access your notes from external programs, you can use the local HTTP server.
The Inkdrop client app can run a simple HTTP server locally.
It is useful for automating tasks such as generating static sites by exporting notes with a tool like [live-export](https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-live-export).
It also allows you to integrate with external programs such as launcher apps like [Raycast](https://docs.inkdrop.app/reference/integrate-with-raycast) and [Alfred](https://docs.inkdrop.app/reference/integrate-with-alfred), [the official MCP server](https://github.com/inkdropapp/mcp-server), [static site generators like Astro](https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-blog-template), etc.{{ className: 'lead' }}

## How it works

![Local REST API endpoint](/images/accessing-the-local-database_local-rest-api-endpoint.png)

By default, the Inkdrop client app declines requests from external networks for security reasons.
It only accepts requests from the loopback network (`localhost` or `127.0.0.1`).
Also, you will set up the authentication credentials to protect unwanted access.

## API reference

See [the local HTTP server reference](/data-access/local-http-server) for more details.

## How to configure the local HTTP server

![Preferences](/images/integrate-with-external-programs_preferences.png)

Open the Preferences window and click the **Local Server** section in the sidebar.

- **Enabled** - Check this box to enable the local HTTP server. Default is unchecked.
- **Port number** - Defines the port number to listen. Default is `19840`.
- **Bind Address** - Defines the IP address to listen. Default is `127.0.0.1`.
- **Username** - Defines username of the Basic auth credentials.
- **Password** - Defines password of the Basic auth credentials.

Click the **Apply** button to apply the changes.
The auth info will be encrypted and stored safely in `config.json` in [the user data directory](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/basic-usage#user-data-directory).

![Server logs](/images/integrate-with-external-programs_server-logs.png)

By pressing the **View Server Logs** button, you can check the server access logs updated in real-time.
The path to the log file is `USER_DATA_DIRECTORY/server.log`.


### Troubleshooting

Check if the local server is running correctly with `curl`:

```sh
curl -v -u foo:bar http://localhost:19840/
# -> {"version":"5.10.0","ok":true}
```

Run the app with `--enable-logging` flag to see the server logs. See [the documentation](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/troubleshooting#enable-logging) for more detail.

```sh
/Applications/Inkdrop.app/Contents/MacOS/Inkdrop --enable-logging
```

If the server is running correctly, you should see logs like this:

```
  app:info Starting server on 127.0.0.1:19840
```

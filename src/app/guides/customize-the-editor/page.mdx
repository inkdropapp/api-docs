# Customize the editor

Inkdrop's text editor is built on top of [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) which is specialized for editing code, and comes with a number of [language modes](https://codemirror.net/mode/index.html) and [addons](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#addons) that implement more advanced editing functionality. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can access the instance of CodeMirror via [MDE](/modules/markdown-editor) like this:

```js
inkdrop.getActiveEditor().cm
```

You can also get a CodeMirror class object by doing `require('codemirror')`.

## How to install addons to CodeMirror

CodeMirror comes with a bunch of addons available to use.
But you can't require them like `require('codemirror/addons/fold/foldcode.js')` because it is not in the search path.
To do so, add a path to the app's `node_modules` to your `require` statements as following:

```js
const app = require('electron').remote.app
const modulePath = app.getAppPath() + '/node_modules/'
require(modulePath + 'codemirror/addon/fold/foldcode.js')
require(modulePath + 'codemirror/addon/fold/foldgutter.js')
require(modulePath + 'codemirror/addon/fold/markdown-fold.js')
```

## When to customize the editor

If you are building a plugin which changes CodeMirror's behaviors, you have to subscribe events to know when the editor is ready.
`global.inkdrop` provides two methods to subscribe events on the editor. You can use them like so:

```js
global.inkdrop.onEditorLoad(editor => console.log('Editor loaded'))
global.inkdrop.onEditorUnload(() => console.log('Editor unloaded'))
```

See also [this page](/modules/environment#editor-load-event) for more detail about the event subscription.

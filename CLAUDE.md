# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Inkdrop API documentation website built with Next.js 14, providing comprehensive guides and API references for developers customizing the Inkdrop application. The site serves as the primary developer documentation for the Inkdrop note-taking app's extensibility features.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Content**: MDX (Markdown + JSX) for documentation pages
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom typography
- **Search**: FlexSearch for client-side fuzzy search
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Shiki for code blocks
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **UI Components**: Headless UI, Framer Motion
- **Build Process**: MDX compilation with custom remark/rehype/recma plugins

### Directory Structure

- `/src/app/` - Documentation content organized by category:
  - `/guides/` - Tutorial-style documentation
  - `/data-access/` - Database API reference
  - `/modules/` - Core module documentation
  - `/states/` - State management docs
  - `/actions/` - Editor actions reference
  - `/components/` - UI component documentation
  - `/appendix/` - Additional reference material
- `/src/components/` - React components for the site
- `/src/mdx/` - MDX processing plugins and search implementation
  - `search.mjs` - Search indexing logic
  - `rehype.mjs` - HTML processing (external links, etc.)
  - `remark.mjs` - Markdown processing
  - `recma.mjs` - JavaScript/JSX processing
- `/public/images/` - Documentation images and screenshots

### Search System

The search implementation (`/src/mdx/search.mjs`) automatically indexes all MDX content:

- Extracts headings and paragraphs from all documentation
- Uses FlexSearch for fuzzy searching
- Triggered by âŒ˜K / Ctrl+K
- Special handling for the commands page (indexes h3 headings)

## Working with Documentation

### Creating New Pages

1. Create an MDX file in the appropriate `/src/app/` subdirectory
2. Add metadata export:

```mdx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Page Title',
  description: 'SEO description'

}
```

3. Add navigation entry in `/src/components/Navigation.jsx`

### MDX Page Structure

```mdx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Title',
  description: 'Description'
}

# Page Title

Lead paragraph explaining the key concept.{{ className: 'lead' }}

## Section Title

Content...
```

### Custom MDX Components

- `<Row>` and `<Col>` - Two-column layouts for API docs
- `<Properties>` and `<Property>` - API property documentation
- `<CodeGroup>` - Multiple code examples with titles
- `<Note>` and `<Warning>` - Callout boxes

### Code Examples

````jsx
<Row>
  <Col>Explanation text...</Col>
  <Col sticky>```javascript // Code example ```</Col>
</Row>
````

### Images

Store in `/public/images/` and reference as:

```mdx
![Alt text](/images/filename.png)
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Navigation

Navigation structure is defined in `/src/components/Navigation.jsx`. Each section contains an array of pages with `title` and `href`.

### Search Index

The search index rebuilds automatically when MDX files change. The indexing logic is in `/src/mdx/search.mjs`.

### External Links

External links automatically:

- Open in new tabs
- Display an external link icon
- Are handled by the rehype plugin in `/src/mdx/rehype.mjs`

### Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks support language-specific highlighting via Shiki. Common languages: javascript, jsx, json, bash, css.

## High-Level Architecture

### MDX Processing Pipeline

The documentation site uses a sophisticated MDX processing pipeline:

1. **Build Time**: MDX files in `/src/app/` are processed through Next.js's MDX loader
2. **Plugins Chain**: 
   - Remark plugins handle Markdown transformations
   - Rehype plugins process HTML (adding external link icons, etc.)
   - Recma plugins handle JavaScript/JSX transformations
3. **Search Indexing**: The `withSearch` wrapper in `next.config.mjs` ensures all MDX content is indexed for search
4. **Section Extraction**: Each MDX file exports a `sections` array used for in-page navigation

### Navigation System

The navigation is centrally managed through several interconnected components:

1. **Navigation Data**: Defined in `/src/components/Navigation.jsx` as a static structure
2. **Dynamic Sections**: The `layout.jsx` file extracts sections from all MDX files at build time
3. **Section Provider**: Uses Zustand to manage active section state for smooth scrolling
4. **Mobile/Desktop Split**: Separate navigation components for responsive design

### Content Organization

Documentation follows a hierarchical structure:

1. **Categories**: Top-level groupings (Guides, Data Access, Core Modules, etc.)
2. **Pages**: Individual MDX files within categories
3. **Sections**: Headings within pages that appear in the sidebar
4. **Anchors**: Auto-generated from heading text for deep linking

## Common Tasks

### Adding API Documentation

1. Create MDX file in appropriate category
2. Use two-column layout with `<Row>` and `<Col>`
3. Document properties with `<Properties>` component
4. Include practical code examples
5. Add to navigation in `/src/components/Navigation.jsx`

### Updating Existing Documentation

1. Edit the MDX file directly
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Verify search indexing works for new content
4. Check that all links and images work correctly

### Debugging Search Issues

- Search index is built from MDX content during build
- Check `/src/mdx/search.mjs` for indexing logic
- Verify content appears in search results after building

## Important Notes

- This is a documentation site without unit tests - focus on content accuracy
- The site uses static generation where possible for performance
- All documentation should follow the established MDX patterns for consistency
- Lead paragraphs (with `{{ className: 'lead' }}`) should summarize key concepts
- Keep code examples practical and directly runnable in Inkdrop
- The site is deployed at https://developers.inkdrop.app/
- All MDX files are automatically indexed for search during the build process
- Navigation is centrally managed in `/src/components/Navigation.jsx`

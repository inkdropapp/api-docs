I'd like to have a button that links to the Markdown source of the current page in the documentation.
The source file is hosted on GitHub, and it can be easily inferred from the current page URL.

For example, if the current page URL is:

- `https://developers.inkdrop.app/guides/access-the-local-database`

The URL to the Markdown source file is:

- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inkdropapp/api-docs/refs/heads/main/src/app/guides/access-the-local-database/page.mdx`
